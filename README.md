## Introduction
For this project, I wanted to explore datasets on books and see which books, authors, types of books, etc. were the highest rated than others. Doing this would provide me insightful information that I could use when picking my next book to read. For this project I used datasets from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bahramjannesarr/goodreads-book-datasets-10m and https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdhamani/goodreads-books-100k that contain hundreds of thousands of rows of data for books from goodreads. These datasets contained information such as the name of the book, IBSN, author, number of pages, genre, rating, etc. I used python to concat the data by combining over 20 csv files into one big datset with over 800k rows. I then used SQL to explore the data. Finally, I visualized interesting information about the dataset in a tableau dashboard that focues on showing the top N books/authors/types of books by its rating/number of pages/number of books.
